** Tkinter Calculator **
This is a simple calculator application built using Python's Tkinter library. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, factorials, and more.
I created this code while I was in my first year of study, and it is fully functional. Feel free to modify and enhance the calculator as you see fit! Check for more Abuthwahir projects
